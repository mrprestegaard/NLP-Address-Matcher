# NLP-Address-Matcher

## Overview (still in testing)
NLP-Address-Matcher is (hopefully) going to be a Python-based tool designed to standardize and parse address data efficiently. It extracts relevant components from raw, unstructured address inputs and prepares them for automated client/account matching and validation. The project leverages a combination of regex-based transformations, predefined mappings (USPS standardizations), and structured parsing techniques to improve address normalization and matching accuracy.

## Features
- **Standardizes Address Components:** Converts common variations and abbreviations into a consistent format.
- **Unit Extraction & Normalization:** Identifies unit designations (e.g., "Suite 300", "Apt 4B") and standardizes them.
- **Structured Address Parsing:** Breaks down addresses into key components such as street number, street name, city, state, and ZIP code.
- **Error Handling for Messy Inputs:** Detects and manages ambiguous or misformatted address entries.
- **Future Scalability:** Designed to integrate machine learning models (BERT, Sequence-to-Sequence, fuzzy matching) for enhanced address validation and comparison.

## Installation
To use NLP-Address-Matcher in your Python environment, clone this repository and install required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrprestegaard/NLP-Address-Matcher.git
cd NLP-Address-Matcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To parse an address and extract key details, use the provided functions:

```python
from address_matcher import parse_us_address

address = "123 Main St Apt. 4B, New York, NY 10001"
parsed_result = parse_us_address(address)
print(parsed_result)
```

**Output Example:**
```json
{
    "Addressee": null,
    "Street Number": "123",
    "Street Name": "Main St",
    "Unit": "Apt 4B",
    "City": "New York",
    "State": "NY",
    "Zip Code": "10001",
    "Country": "USA"
}
```

## Applications
- **Client Record Matching:** Standardizing and comparing customer addresses to identify duplicates or inconsistencies.
- **Database Cleanup:** Ensuring address consistency across structured databases.
- **Logistics & Shipping:** Improving address validation for package delivery systems.
- **Fraud Detection:** Enhancing identity verification by cross-referencing address data.

## Roadmap
- Implement machine learning-based address normalization and entity recognition.
- Enhance fuzzy matching for more accurate historical record comparisons.
- Expand support for international addresses.
- Optimize processing speed for bulk address handling.
